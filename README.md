# Helios TypeWriter
A basic rich text editor built in Visual Basic .NET.

**Note:** A new and improved version of TypeWriter will be released in a few days. If you are planning to clone this repository, we recommend you wait until the new release. Also, for development, you will need Lazarus, rather than Visual Studio, as it will be written in Pascal.
